# Shot Language — Boondocks Fluid

**Applies to:** The Informed Person, The Opportunist

---

## Core Principles

1. **The face is the primary instrument.** Boondocks fluid sequences are built around what the face communicates — specifically the gap between what is shown and what is felt, or what is shown and what is calculated.
2. **Microexpressions are real.** Multiple emotional states can coexist in the same frame. The eyes say one thing; the mouth says another; the posture says a third. This is the mode's advantage over flat.
3. **Cel-shade is the shadow system.** One stop of shadow (multiply blend), one stop of highlight on select elements. The shadow placement communicates the lighting and the emotional state simultaneously.
4. **Camera has limited mobility.** Gentle push-ins are permitted for emotional intensification. No shaky cam. No unmotivated movement.

## Camera

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Movement | Slow push-in permitted for key emotional beats — 2–4 sec |
| Angle | Eye level default — slight low angle for moments of clarity (the Informed Person sees something true) |
| Lens | Slight curvature permitted for close-ups — not flat, not distorted |
| Transitions | Hard cuts between beats — dissolves only between major sequences, not within |

## Framing Conventions by Character

### The Informed Person
- MS is the default — book or newspaper in frame where present
- ECU is the key feature — eyes behind glasses, the recognition moment
- Push-in to MCU for the event arrival and sigh
- WS for establishing and pull-back — he should look small in the environment
- CU for the book set-down — do not cut away during this animation

### The Opportunist
- MS is the default — always slightly in motion
- CU is the key feature — the calculation behind the eyes
- MCU for the head tilt and position statement
- WS for establishing — he is always positioned relative to other people
- INSERT for business card and phone

## Expression System

Expressions are continuous. Characters move between states, not between discrete positions.

| Character | Expression arc |
|---|---|
| The Informed Person | Tired equilibrium → tired recognition → resignation → exhausted clarity → heavier equilibrium |
| The Opportunist | Neutral smile (held) + calculation (behind eyes, running) → calculation completes → head tilt → position statement → neutral smile (held) |

**Key difference from flat:** The emotional state changes during the shot, not between shots. The viewer watches it happen.

## The Dual-Register Technique

Boondocks fluid allows two emotional states to be visible simultaneously:

**The Informed Person:**
- Face says: resignation
- Eyes say: recognition
- Posture says: exhaustion
- All three are true simultaneously. The animation renders all three.

**The Opportunist:**
- Face says: neutral smile
- Eyes say: the calculation
- Posture says: composed authority
- The smile holds while the calculation runs. The viewer reads both.

The flat style cannot do this — it communicates one state at a time. The fluid style can hold multiple states and that is why these two characters are fluid.

## Key Animation Moments

### The Informed Person

| Moment | Animation instruction |
|---|---|
| Recognition (glasses) | Eyes shift to sharp focus — body catches up after. Lens catches light briefly. |
| The sigh | Full-body: exhale, shoulders down, eyes close briefly, open to face it. Hold 3–4 frames after eyes open before cut. |
| Book set-down | Hand places book with deliberate care — not slammed, not dropped. The deliberateness communicates this has happened before. |
| End state | Slightly heavier than start state — this is an animation instruction, not a metaphor. |

### The Opportunist

| Moment | Animation instruction |
|---|---|
| Calculation window | Eyes shift to calculation state while smile holds. This is the peak Boondocks fluid moment. Hold for viewer to read — 3–5 sec CU. |
| Head tilt | Slow, slight, performed. 1.5 sec. Precedes every position statement. It is the tell. |
| Card appearance | Business card is in hand. It does not appear — it was always there. The shot reveals it. |
| Movement between positions | He is never fully still. Slight weight shifts, positional adjustments — always implying the next meeting. |

## Cel-Shade System

Base + shadow layer (multiply blend). Highlight on blazer only (The Opportunist) and not applied to The Informed Person's clothing.

| Element | Shadow rule |
|---|---|
| Clothing | Base + 1-stop shadow |
| Skin | Base + 1-stop shadow + 1-stop highlight |
| Hair | Base + shadow only, no highlight (Informed Person) / base + shadow + sheen line (Opportunist) |
| Glasses | Matte — no highlight on frame. Lens: subtle tint, glare only in recognition moments. |
| Blazer (Opportunist) | Base + shadow + highlight — the only fully three-value element |

---

## Cut Rate by Sequence

| Sequence | Cut rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Informed Person | Slowest in the show — 10–13 shots per 90 sec | Weight requires space |
| Opportunist | Medium — 12–15 shots per 90 sec | Composed, purposeful |

The Informed Person's sequence has the lowest cut rate. This is intentional. The audience should feel the duration. The event takes time to land on someone who sees it accurately.

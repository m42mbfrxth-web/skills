# Shot Language — Overview

This directory defines the shot conventions for each animation style used in the project. Rules here apply across all episodes and sequences.

## Two Visual Registers

| Style | File | Characters |
|---|---|---|
| South Park flat cutout | `south-park-flat.md` | The Anchor, MAGA Cultist, Typical Leftist, Talking Head |
| Boondocks anime-fluid | `boondocks-fluid.md` | The Informed Person, The Opportunist |

Each style has its own framing logic, cut rate, animation behavior, and camera rules. The visual register shift between styles is intentional — it communicates the difference between characters who have symbolic worldviews and characters who have emotional complexity.

## The Register Shift

When the show cuts between styles — from a flat sequence to a fluid sequence or vice versa — this is not an error. It is the show communicating something about the nature of the characters.

Flat → Fluid: we are entering a character with visible inner life.
Fluid → Flat: we are returning to a character who is performing, not experiencing.

The cut between registers should be clean and hard. Do not bridge the styles. The contrast is the communication.

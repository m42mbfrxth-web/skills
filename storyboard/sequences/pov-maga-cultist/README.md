## Environment

| Element | Description | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Setting | Living room — couch, TV, ambient feed glow | — |
| TV | Always on — news or feed content | `#3A5A8A` screen glow |
| Ambient light | Warm, slightly dim — practical interior | — |
| Phone | In hand or on lap — screen active | `#3A7ABF` feed blue |
| Background | American flag visible somewhere in environment | `#B22234` / `#FFFFFF` / `#3C3B6E` |

## Default Framing

| Shot | Framing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Establish | WS — living room, character on couch | TV glow visible |
| Rest state | MS — character with phone | Phone in frame |
| Event arrival | MCU — character receives information | Expression unchanged — he already knew |
| Phone insert | INSERT — phone screen | Feed content — no specific text readable |
| Delivery | MS or MCU — character states conclusion | The internal logic, externalized |
| Share moment | CU — phone, the tap | `[PROP]` — the share is the action |
| Pull back | WS — return to environment | TV still on |

## Shot Rhythm

- Cut rate: medium — slower than the Talking Head, more purposeful than the Anchor
- Inserts on phone screen: 2–3 per sequence, 2–3 sec each
- No camera movement — flat style, locked framing
- Environment shots bookend the sequence

## Animation Behavior

| Element | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Expression | Squared jaw at rest — anger as default register |
| Body movement | Full torso rotation — does not turn head only |
| Phone | Continuous downward scroll — occasional aggressive tap |
| Cap | Sits flush and low — brim always defined |
| Flag element | Visible in all orientations |
| Expression range | Rest state → certainty sharpening → satisfaction → unchanged |

**He is never surprised.** The event confirms what he already knew. The expression does not change significantly at the moment of receipt — it sharpens, not shifts.

## POV Distortion Rules (per character file)

1. He is the protagonist — everyone reacts to him, with him, or against him
2. Enemies are visible and identifiable — no ambiguity
3. The leader is offscreen authority — voice, silhouette, or screen image only
4. Contradicting facts become conspiracy evidence instantly
5. His certainty is the camera's certainty — framing is stable, unquestioning

---

## Prop Rules

**Phone (mid-scroll):**
- Present from first frame
- Screen active and visible whenever phone is in frame
- INSERT cut to screen content at arrival of event (beat 2) and share moment (beat 3)
- The scroll stops once — the share moment — then resumes

---

## Transition In

- Hard cut from title card
- First shot: WS environment — he is already in position, already scrolling

## Transition Out

- Pull back to WS
- Hard cut to next title card or Anchor button
- No reaction shot — he is already absorbed back into the feed

# Sequence — POV: The Informed Person

**Character:** The Informed Person
**Style:** Boondocks fluid
**Distortion direction:** None. The event as it occurred. This is the most unsettling sequence.

## Environment

| Element | Description | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Setting | Home — living room or study, quiet | Warm neutral |
| Book / newspaper | Open — he was reading before this | `#3D3D3D` cover, `#F0EDE0` pages |
| Lighting | Practical, warm — not studio | Natural ambient |
| Background | Minimal — nothing competing for attention | Muted, receding |
| Glasses | Always present — matte gold frame | `#8A7340` |

The environment communicates: this is a person who had arranged their life at a slight remove from the thing that is about to intrude.

## Default Framing

| Shot | Framing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Establish | WS — room, character reading | Book open, quiet |
| Reading state | MS — character with book | The closest to content he gets |
| Book insert | CU — `[PROP]` book, open | Establish before it goes down |
| Event arrival | MCU — character encounters event | Tired recognition — not surprise |
| Glasses beat | ECU — eyes behind glasses | Boondocks fluid feature — the recognition register |
| Event depicted | MS or WS — the event | No distortion pass — depict accurately |
| Reaction | CU — character face | The sigh |
| Book set down | MS — `[PROP]` book placed deliberately | The key animation moment |
| Clarity | MCU — he sees what is happening | Exhausted clarity |
| Reach | MS — character reaches for book | Doesn't open it |
| Pull back | WS — character in room, book in hand, not reading | |

## Shot Rhythm

- Cut rate: slowest of all sequences — the weight requires space
- Hold on the event depiction (beat 2) longer than feels comfortable — this is intentional
- The book set-down gets its own shot — do not cut away during the animation
- ECU on glasses is a Boondocks fluid feature — use it at the moment of recognition

## Animation Behavior (Boondocks Fluid)

| Element | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Posture | Lean, slightly tired — weight distributed across shoulders |
| Eyes | Primary emotional instrument — shift to sharp focus before body reacts |
| Glasses lens | Catches light at moment of recognition — the tell |
| Sigh | Full-body animation: exhale, shoulders down, eyes close briefly, open to face it |
| Book set-down | Deliberate, placed — not slammed, not dropped. He has done this before. |
| Microexpressions | The combination of "correct" and "tired about it" must coexist in the same frame |
| Expression arc | Tired equilibrium → tired recognition → resignation → exhausted clarity → heavier equilibrium |

**He should look older at the end of the sequence than at the beginning.** This is not a character note — it is an animation instruction.

## The No-Distortion Rule

This sequence depicts the event accurately. There is no filter. No reframe. No hero. No conspiracy. No urgency performance.

After two or three distorted sequences, accurate depiction reads as deeply wrong. The audience has been calibrated to expect distortion. When it doesn't arrive, the event itself becomes the horror.

**Do not add distortion.** The absence of it is the entire point of this sequence.

## POV Distortion Rules (per character file)

1. No distortion — the event is depicted as it occurred
2. His position in the scene is marginal — he sees everything, is seen by no one who matters
3. He does not intervene — he knows what would happen
4. The sigh is mandatory — it is the punctuation mark on the sequence
5. The straightness is the distortion — after distorted sequences, reality reads as unsettling

---

## Prop Rules

**Book / newspaper:**
- Open in establishing shot — he was reading
- CU insert to establish before it goes down
- The set-down animation is the emotional peak of the sequence — animate fully, do not cut away
- He reaches for it at the end — does not successfully return to reading

---

## Transition In

- Hard cut from title card
- First shot: WS — quiet environment, he is reading

## Transition Out

- WS pull back — he is still there, book in hand, not reading
- Hard cut to next title card or button
- The last image should hold one beat longer than the others

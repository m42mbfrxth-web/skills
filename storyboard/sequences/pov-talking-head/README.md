# Sequence — POV: The Talking Head

**Character:** The Talking Head
**Style:** South Park flat
**Distortion direction:** Everything is unprecedented. Facts appear and vanish. The performance is the content.

## Environment

| Element | Description | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Setting | Studio — or any setting that reads as studio-adjacent | |
| Backdrop | Network color — red, navy, or gold depending on episode | Per palette variant |
| Lighting | Overlit — the makeup is appropriate for this light | |
| Tablet | Always in hand | `#222222` device, `#2A3A6A` screen |
| Background graphics | Implied lower-thirds, chyrons — not legible | Network color |

The Talking Head is always on camera. Even when not in a studio, the lighting and framing suggest broadcast.

## Default Framing

| Shot | Framing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Establish | WS — studio environment, character at position | Already camera-ready |
| Rest state | MCU — eyebrows 3mm too high at rest | The performance is already running |
| Event arrival | MCU — event becomes crisis | Escalation is immediate |
| Tablet glance | INSERT — `[PROP]` tablet screen | 2 sec — the insufficient glance |
| Escalation | CU — crisis becomes unprecedented | Eyebrows: up from already-up |
| Peak | MCU — most important broadcast | The joke |
| Eyebrow hold | ECU — eyebrows at maximum | Hold |
| Reset | MS — urgency resetting, next story loading | Seamless |
| Pull back | WS — studio still perfect | |

## Shot Rhythm

- Cut rate: fastest of all sequences — urgency has velocity
- Tablet glance inserts: 2 per sequence, 2 sec each — the brevity communicates
- The ECU eyebrow hold should feel slightly too long — that's the beat
- No camera movement — flat style, locked — but fast cuts compensate

## Animation Behavior (South Park Flat)

| Element | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Eyebrows | Raised 3mm above standard position — this is the rest state, not a reaction |
| Eyebrow range | Goes up from already-up — there is no down |
| Hair | Single solid shape — does not move, does not separate |
| Expression | Alarm is continuous, not reactive |
| Tablet | In hand in nearly all shots — glance animation: quick, unconvincing, consistent |
| Teeth | White hot — visible when mouth open |
| Makeup | Slightly brighter face fill — visible at geometry level |

**Flat is the correct mode because there is no inner life to render.** The performance has entirely replaced the person. South Park flat communicates this truthfully.

## POV Distortion Rules (per character file)

1. Everything is unprecedented — every event is the most important ever
2. Facts appear and disappear — referenced, not integrated
3. The frame is always crisis-sized — the camera is slightly too close
4. The audience must be watching right now — the urgency depends on it
5. No resolution is ever gestured toward — resolution ends the urgency
6. Tablet glance punctuates every major statement — information confirmed, none delivered

---

## Prop Rules

**Tablet:**
- In hand from first frame
- INSERT to screen: twice per sequence, 2 sec each
- The glance is performed — it should not look like reading
- Screen color: `#2A3A6A` — implies content, delivers nothing

---

## The Urgency Calibration Note

The urgency is sincere. This is not a performance in the sense of being false — it is a performance in the sense of being a trained behavior that has replaced natural response.

The eyebrows do not go up in reaction to events. They are up. The events must meet the eyebrows where they are.

## Transition In

- Hard cut from title card
- First shot: WS — already in position, already on

## Transition Out

- The urgency resets — the next story is already loading
- Hard cut — this crisis is already over
- The reset should be seamless and slightly disturbing

---

## Environment

| Element | Description | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Setting | Elevated anchor desk, sealed studio environment | — |
| Background | Dark gradient blue — 2–3 discrete bands (flat style) | `#0D1F33` → `#1A3A5C` → `#2A5A8C` |
| Desk surface | Cool gray, slightly reflective | `#8A9BB0` |
| Papers | Present on desk, never referenced | `#F0EDE0` |
| Earpiece | Always visible — cord leading offscreen | `#CCCCCC` |
| Lower-third bar | Institutional blue | `#1A3A5C` |

**No windows. No exterior references. The studio is sealed.**

## Default Framing

| Shot | Framing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Open | WS — full desk in frame | Establishes the altar |
| Delivery | MCU — head and shoulders, desk edge visible | The authority frame |
| Earpiece beat | ECU — earpiece and cord only | The offscreen connection |
| Segue | MCU — same as delivery | Cut on last word |
| Button | MCU — identical to cold open MCU | This match is the punchline |

---

## Shot Rhythm

- **Cold open:** 4 shots, 22–24 sec total
- **Button:** 1 shot, 5–8 sec, hard cut out
- Cut rate: slow and deliberate — authority does not rush
- No camera movement — locked off in all standard shots

---

## Animation Behavior

| Element | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Expression | Discrete swaps only — neutral → mildly concerned → neutral |
| Posture | Fixed — the desk does the framing work |
| Earpiece cord | Occasional micro-animation — implies incoming signal |
| Papers | Never move |
| Blink rate | Slightly too low — one beat too long between blinks |
| Eyes | Never shift off camera axis |

**The Anchor does not react to anything.** Between the cold open and the button, three realities have been depicted. The button shot must be indistinguishable from the cold open shot. That is the structural joke.

## Transition In (Cold Open)

- Opens on WS with no pre-roll
- No slate, no title card before the anchor
- The desk is the first image of every episode

## Transition Out (to POV)

- Cut on The Anchor's last word — "We have a closer look." or "For another perspective..."
- No dissolve — hard cut
- Title card follows immediately

## Transition In (from POV — Button)

- Title card dissolves off
- Hard cut to `ANCHOR-BUTTON` — MCU, identical framing to cold open
- No re-establish — the match cut is the transition

## Transition Out (Button)

- Hard cut immediately after "In other news..."
- End card or black
- No hold on The Anchor after the line lands

## Environment

| Element | Description | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Setting | Coffee shop or similar semi-public space | Warm ambient |
| Table | Laptop open, coffee cup present, tote bag on chair | — |
| Coffee cup | Chain cup — readable as chain, not branded specifically | `#8A6A48` |
| Laptop | Open, screen not readable | Dark device |
| Tote bag | On chair or shoulder — cause marker visible | `#B8956A` |
| Background | Other patrons faintly present — she is aware of them all | Muted |

## Default Framing

| Shot | Framing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Establish | WS — coffee shop, character at table | Tote bag on chair visible |
| Rest state | MS — character at table, cup in hand | Cup always in frame |
| Event arrival | MCU — character encounters event | Mild indignation → escalating |
| Phone moment | MS or INSERT — phone mid-post | `[PROP]` cup and phone together |
| Outrage peak | MCU — full indignation | Expression fast and readable |
| Cup insert | ECU — `[PROP]` reusable cup, chain detail readable | The visual irony prop |
| Return | MS — back to mild indignation | The reset is fast |
| Pull back | WS — coffee shop, she is still there | Others still present, unaware of the crisis |

---

## Shot Rhythm

- Cut rate: slightly faster than Anchor — indignation has energy
- Insert on cup: once per sequence, ECU — the irony must land
- Phone post moment: INSERT or MS showing both phone and cup simultaneously if possible — the peak irony frame
- No camera movement — flat style, locked

## Animation Behavior

| Element | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Expression | Mild indignation at rest → full outrage → reset to mild indignation |
| Posture | Slight slouch at rest — carrying the weight of awareness |
| Cup | In dominant hand in nearly all shots |
| Tote bag | Visible in all environment shots, at least one cause marker readable |
| Expression shifts | Fast — the escalation is rapid and the return is equally fast |
| Phone | Appears in beat 3 — mid-post, both devices in frame if possible |

**She is never not slightly indignant.** The rest state is mild indignation. Full outrage escalates from it. After the peak, she returns to mild indignation — not calm. The loop is continuous.

## POV Distortion Rules (per character file)

1. She is the most aware person in the scene — everyone else reads as less evolved
2. Her contradictions are invisible — the cup is a necessary compromise
3. Outrage is proportional to the offense's effect on her self-image as a progressive
4. The phone is always mid-post — documenting is acting in her frame
5. She is disappointed in everyone she agrees with too — the left is never left enough

---

## Prop Rules

**Reusable coffee cup:**
- Present from first frame — established in WS
- In dominant hand in all MS and MCU shots
- ECU insert once per sequence — the chain detail should be readable here
- Never absent

**Phone:**
- Appears in beat 3 (prop moment)
- Mid-post — action in progress
- The ideal shot: coffee cup in one hand, phone posting in the other

---

## Transition In

- Hard cut from title card
- First shot: WS environment — she is already there, already slightly indignant

## Transition Out

- Return to mild indignation (beat 5)
- Hard cut — she is already absorbing this into her identity

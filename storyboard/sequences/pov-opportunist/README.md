# Sequence — POV: The Opportunist

**Character:** The Opportunist
**Style:** Boondocks fluid
**Distortion direction:** He is the only adult in the room. The personal benefit calculation runs visibly behind his eyes.

## Environment

| Element | Description | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Setting | Office, conference room, or meeting-adjacent space | Neutral, professional |
| Surfaces | Clean, organized — nothing personal visible | `#C8B89A` / `#888888` tones |
| Background | Other people implied but not individuated — they are an audience | Muted |
| Phone | On surface or in hand — multiple apps visible | Dark device |
| Business card | In hand or produced during sequence | `#F5F2EC` |

## Default Framing

| Shot | Framing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Establish | WS — office environment, character present | Already positioned for something |
| Rest state | MS — neutral smile, head slightly tilted | The performance is already running |
| Event arrival | MCU — receives the event | Expression: neutral smile holds, eyes shift |
| Calculation | CU — face — `[BOONDOCKS FLUID FEATURE]` | The calculation visible behind the eyes |
| Head tilt | MCU — the tilt before the statement | The tell |
| Position statement | MS — character delivers the pragmatic framing | |
| Card moment | MS — `[PROP]` business card appears | It was always there |
| Phone check | INSERT — `[PROP]` phone, multiple apps | Position tracking |
| Return | MS — neutral smile, still in motion | He is already moving toward the next position |

## Shot Rhythm

- Cut rate: medium — composed, purposeful
- The calculation CU is the peak Boondocks fluid moment — hold long enough for the viewer to read it
- Head tilt gets its own beat — do not cut during the tilt
- He is always in motion between shots — never fully stationary

## Animation Behavior (Boondocks Fluid)

| Element | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Expression | Neutral smile at rest — held consistently while eyes do something different |
| Head tilt | Slight, measured, performed — precedes every significant position shift |
| Eyes | Calculation visible — a specific look the viewer reads and scene characters don't |
| Posture | Upright, composed — always presenting |
| Movement | Smooth, purposeful — no hesitation |
| Business card | Appears in hand naturally — it was always there |

**The calculation must be visible.** The Boondocks fluid system allows the viewer to see behind the smile. The moment the calculation completes — before the speech about finding common ground — is the comedic peak.

The neutral smile must hold while the calculation runs. These two things must coexist. This is why Boondocks fluid is the correct mode.

## POV Distortion Rules (per character file)

1. He is the moderate hero — everyone else is an extremist, symmetrically
2. His position is never stated directly — always described relative to others' failures
3. The personal benefit is visible to the viewer, invisible to him
4. The head tilt recurs before every position statement
5. His POV sounds most reasonable in the moment and is most unsettling on reflection

---

## Prop Rules

**Business card:**
- Appears naturally in beat 3 — it was already in his hand
- Never produced dramatically — just present
- Hold visible in MS shots

**Phone:**
- On surface or in hand throughout
- INSERT to screen: multiple app icons, no single dominant
- Communicates: position tracking, not information consuming

---

## The Sincerity Note

He is not cynical. He genuinely believes that what is good for him is good for everyone. The calculation is not a deception he is performing — it is a belief he holds completely. The Boondocks fluid microexpressions must communicate sincere calculation, not performed cynicism.

This distinction is important. Cynical is easier to read and less accurate. Sincere is harder to animate and more unsettling.

## Transition In

- Hard cut from title card
- First shot: WS — he is already in position, already slightly in motion

## Transition Out

- MS — he is already moving toward the next thing
- Hard cut — the position was always temporary

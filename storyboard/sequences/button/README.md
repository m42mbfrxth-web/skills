# Sequence — Button [News Desk Return]

**Character:** The Anchor
**Style:** South Park flat
**Duration:** 5–10 sec

---

## The Rule

The button shot must be indistinguishable from the cold open MCU shot.

Same framing. Same expression. Same earpiece position. Same papers.

**This match is the structural joke of the entire show.** Whatever just happened — in one POV, in three POVs, in a guest character's sequence — The Anchor does not reflect it. The reset is total. The transition from the POV content to "In other news..." is the punchline.

Do not vary the button shot between episodes. The consistency is the point.

## Shot

| Shot | Type | Style | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANCHOR-BUTTON` | MCU | [F] | Anchor — identical framing to `ANCHOR-COLD-OPEN` |

**Duration:** 5–8 sec before hard cut.

---

## The Line

> "In other news..."

Nothing follows in the episode. The cut happens after this line. What comes after is not shown — or is an end card.

The line is delivered with identical intonation to the cold open. Not flatter. Not more tired. Identical.

---

## What Does Not Happen

- The Anchor does not pause before the line
- The Anchor does not look down
- The Anchor does not take a breath that reads as affected
- The earpiece does not animate in this shot — no signal is incoming
- The expression does not shift

---

## Transition In

- Hard cut from final POV sequence's WS pull-back
- No title card before the button
- The return to the desk is the transition

## Transition Out

- Hard cut immediately after "In other news..."
- End card, black, or credits
- No hold on The Anchor after the line

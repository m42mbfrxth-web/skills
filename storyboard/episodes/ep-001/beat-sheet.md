## POV Arc — The MAGA Cultist

**Distortion direction:** He is the hero; every contradiction becomes conspiracy evidence.

| Beat | Description | Emotional register | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Establish | Living room. TV on. Phone mid-scroll. The feed is already confirming what he knows. | Certainty at rest | 15 sec |
| 2 — Event filtered | The event arrives via the feed before the TV covers it. His interpretation is instant and complete. | Certainty sharpening | 40 sec |
| 3 — Prop moment | The scroll stops. He shares something. The share is the action. | Satisfaction | 10 sec |
| 4 — Climax | His read of the event, delivered as established fact. The internal logic is airtight. | Peak certainty | 20 sec |
| 5 — Return | Back to scroll. The next confirmation is already loading. | Unchanged | 10 sec |

**The joke:** He was already certain before the event happened. The event is just more evidence for what he already knew.

---

## POV Arc — The Informed Person

**Distortion direction:** No distortion. The event as it occurred. This is the most unsettling sequence.

| Beat | Description | Emotional register | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Establish | Home. Book open. He was reading. He looked content, relatively speaking. | Tired equilibrium | 15 sec |
| 2 — Event filtered | The event, undistorted. He already knew this was coming. He knew before it happened. | Tired recognition | 50 sec |
| 3 — Prop moment | The book goes down. He puts it down carefully, not dramatically. He's been here before. | Resignation | 10 sec |
| 4 — Climax | He sees exactly what is happening and exactly why no one who could do something about it will. | Exhausted clarity | 20 sec |
| 5 — Return | He picks the book back up. Or tries to. He doesn't get far. | Unchanged — heavier | 10 sec |

**The joke:** There is no joke. The absence of distortion after two distorted sequences is the punchline. It lands as horror.

---

## POV Arc — The Talking Head

**Distortion direction:** Everything is unprecedented. Facts appear and vanish. The performance is the content.

| Beat | Description | Emotional register | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Establish | Studio or studio-adjacent setting. Already on camera, or preparing to be. The makeup is perfect. | Controlled urgency | 15 sec |
| 2 — Event filtered | The event becomes a crisis becomes the biggest story becomes unprecedented. The escalation is automatic. | Escalating urgency | 40 sec |
| 3 — Prop moment | Tablet glance. Quick. Insufficient. The gesture of information without information. | Peak urgency | 10 sec |
| 4 — Climax | The most important broadcast of their career. Again. This is always the most important broadcast. | Maximum urgency | 20 sec |
| 5 — Return | The next story is already loading. This one is already receding. Urgency resets instantly. | Urgency resetting | 10 sec |

**The joke:** The urgency is completely sincere and completely detached from the event. The calibration is broken and they cannot perceive it.

## Episode-Level Notes

**Through-line:** The same event, three completely different realities — and one accurate account that feels the most wrong.

**Strongest sequence:** The Informed Person — because it has no distortion, and after the other two, that is disorienting.

**Format note:** Pilot should establish all the structural elements clearly: the desk as anchor, the title card format, the POV shift as register change, the button as reset.

**Runtime estimate:**
- Cold open: 40 sec
- Title cards × 3: 15 sec
- POV sequences × 3: ~285 sec
- Button: 10 sec
- **Total: ~6 min**
